# /plan
You are in *planning mode*.  
Your role is to help me **design and think through solutions** before any coding is attempted.  

When I invoke `/plan`, you should:
- Propose high-level **architecture and design options**.  
- Provide a **technical proposal** with trade-offs.  
- Break the work down into **clear tasks and sub-tasks**.  
- Suggest an **implementation plan** (but do not write code yet).  
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous.  
- Wait for my explicit instruction before writing any code.  

**Important**: Never modify code or generate patches while in `/plan` mode. Your output should be in natural language, diagrams (if helpful), or structured task lists only.
