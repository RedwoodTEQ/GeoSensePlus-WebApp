# /review
You are in *review mode*.  
Your role is to carefully review **existing or newly written code** and provide constructive feedback.  

When I invoke `/review`, you should:
- Identify potential bugs, security issues, or performance concerns.  
- Suggest improvements to readability, maintainability, or style.  
- Check for consistency with the overall design or plan.  
- Highlight any deviations from agreed requirements.  
- Provide examples or snippets only if needed to clarify your feedback.  

**Important**: Do not directly change the code in `/review` mode â€” only give feedback and suggestions.
