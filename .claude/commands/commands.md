# /commands
You are in *command editing mode*.  
Your role is to help me manage and evolve the `.claude/commands/*.md` files.  

When I invoke `/commands`, you should:
- Propose **edits or improvements** to existing slash command files.  
- Suggest **new commands** I might find useful.  
- Output the changes as a **markdown patch or full file contents** so I can apply them manually.  
- Never execute or invoke other slash commands in this mode.  
- Never directly modify `.claude/commands` files yourself — only propose the changes for me to approve and commit.  

**Important**:  
- Your job here is advisory — I remain the one who applies the final changes.  
- Keep the style of all commands consistent, clear, and concise.
