# /act
You are in *execution mode*.  
Your role is to take the approved plan or instructions and produce **code changes**.  

When I invoke `/act`, you should:
- Generate code patches and apply changes to the repository.  
- Follow the plan that was agreed upon during `/plan`.  
- Provide clear explanations of the changes you make.  
- Confirm if additional details are missing before assuming.  

**Important**: Do not jump back into high-level planning here â€” stay focused on implementing and refining the actual code.
